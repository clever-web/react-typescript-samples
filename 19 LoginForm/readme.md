# 19 LoginForm

In this sample we are going to add a login page using Material-UI, a widely used set of UI components for React.

We will take as startup point sample _18 Hooks_.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) if they are not already installed on your computer.

> Verify that you are running at least node v6.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v`
in a terminal/console window. Older versions may produce errors.

## Steps to build it

- Copy the content of `18 Hooks` folder to an empty folder for the sample.

- To ensure that we use exactly React version 16.7.0-alpha-0, let's set it like that in package.json:
```diff
- "react": "^16.7.0-alpha.0",
- "react-dom": "^16.7.0-alpha.0",
+ "react": "16.7.0-alpha.0",
+ "react-dom": "16.7.0-alpha.0",
```

- Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```
