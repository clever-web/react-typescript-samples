# 07 Form

In this sample we will add a link in the members page that will navigate to a "new member page". This new page will display a form where you have to enter the avatar url, login and id of a new member (just supossing we can edit that info).

We will take a startup point sample _06 AJAX Call_.

Summary steps:

- Update `About` component content.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.6.0) if they are not already
installed on your computer.

> Verify that you are running at least node v6.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v`
in a terminal/console window. Older versions may produce errors.

## Steps to build it

- Copy the content of the `06 AJAX Call` folder to an empty folder for the sample.

- Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

 ```bash
 $ npm install
 ```

- We update`About` content to show sample `07 Form` highlights. You can see updates in `./src/components/about.tsx`.

- Execute the example:

 ```bash
 $ npm start
 ```
