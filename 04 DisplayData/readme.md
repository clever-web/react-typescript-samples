# 04 DisplayData

In this sample we will create a members page, adding navigation using react-router.

We will take a startup point sample _03 Navigation_.

Summary steps:

- Update `About` component content.
- Create member `API`.
- Update `Members Page`.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.6.0) if they are not already
installed on your computer.

> Verify that you are running at least node v6.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v`
in a terminal/console window. Older versions may produce errors.

## Steps to build it

- Copy the content of the `03 Navigation` folder to an empty folder for the sample.

- Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

 ```bash
 $ npm install
 ```

- We update`About` content to show sample `04 DisplayData` highlights. You can see updates in `./src/components/about.tsx`.



- Execute the example:

 ```bash
 $ npm start
 ```
